# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

A python learning objectives:

- What are lists and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- What is the del statement and how to use it

## Requirements
- Editors used: vi, vim, emacs
- All Files was  interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 
- All your files must be executable

#### Python scripts
- All your files was interpreted using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files used the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

#### C scripts
- All your files was compiled using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files use the Betty style. It was checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
